Due to the size limit of GitHub, the code and all the datasets used can be found at 

https://osf.io/9w7ks/?view_only=c96e5611809845568b8c0d81acdb2b46




Requirements:

  Python 3.6
  
  Tensorflow r1.0.1
  
  CUDA 7.5+
  
  
  
  
All the defult parameters are listed in 'train.py' inside the SeqGAN folder. To train SeqGAN, run


'$ python train.py'


The generated data should appear inside the 'save' folder, which can be used to further fine-tune HateBERT.
